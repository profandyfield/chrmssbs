abstract: "This chapter gives a brief overview of R, an open source software environment for statistical computing. We begin by explaining the benfits of using R alongside the RStudio IDE and a document production application called Quarto. We provide recommendations about workflow best practice and introduce core concepts within the R eco-system. We then move to an overview of coding by exploring the key concepts relevant to R. Next, we briefly explore how to import data into R. The final section of the chapter brings the fundamental ideas discussed to life by reproducing some reported analyses from a study conducted by @perchtold2019.

R [@rcoreteam2024] is a powerful open source software environment for statistical computing and graphics released in 2000 (after 8 years of development). Much of this strength comes from the fact that the core application (so called 'base R') can be extended by installing and loading 'packages' developed by individuals and organisations. Most packages are stored on a central repository managed by the R core development team known as CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), but many authors develop their packages using GitHub making it possible to install packages directly from the GitHub website. At the time of writing there are 21,939 packages on CRAN, which demonstrates the vastness of the ecosystem. Whatever you want to do with your data, the chances are someone has written a package that enables you to do it.

Unlike many popular applications for data processing, visualisation and statistical analysis (e.g., IBM SPSS Statistics, JASP, Jamovi, Minitab), which rely on a point-and-click graphical user interface (GUI), R is script-based. This has some advantages (which we will address later), but also means that R has a relatively steep learning curve for those most comfortable with GUI-based software. Why then, should you climb that educational mountain?

For an academic, perhaps the most compelling reason to learn R is that it fits seamlessly with a workflow that promotes open science and reproducibility [@munafò2017], which is an increasingly vital part of the scientific process. Point-and-click software for data processing and statistical modelling are inherently not reproducible: there is no obvious record of what has been done and mistakes are not traceable [@simons2019]. This is a simplification because, for example, IBM SPSS Statistics stores a journal of activity using a syntax language, linking a particular part of that file to a particular analysis is, at best, tricky. More recently IBM SPSS Statistics has introduced a workbook file that integrates translates point and click activity into syntax that is stored along with output. Although this vastly improves reproducibility it is still not possible to produce integrated, formatted reports. As we shall see when we discuss workflow, using R it is possible to create academic papers and reports that embed the analysis code meaning that anyone can reproduce an entire academic paper with a click of a button. R integrates seamlessly with GitHub, which in turn integrates with popular open science repositories such as the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/), making it convenient to create open, reproducible scientific projects.

A second reason for investing time in R is that by being open source, it has a wider range of tools than most proprietary software and is able to keep pace with the rapidly changing world of data science and statistics. For example, structural equation models typically require specialist proprietary software such as AMOS and MPLus, whereas these models are handled within R by importing packages such as `lavaan` [@lavaan]. Also, there are examples of widely-used statistical methods that are not readily available in proprietary statistics software such as robust estimation, Bayesian estimation, and network analysis. Other applications such as JASP can, for example, estimate Bayesian model but it uses R under the hood (as does jamovi) so the range of tools available depends on the developers choices about what to implement. If you learn R, you make those decisions.

Finally, for those with secret desires to work outside the academy, R is also a useful transferable skill. According to a 2020 survey of 579 analytic professionals from 71 countries, R and Python (another programming language) are by far the most widely used. Around a quarter of consultants and corporate analysts list R as their primary tool (joint highest with Python), in academia it is 41% (compared to 10% for IBM SPSS Statistics) and for non-profits it is 48% [@rexeranalytics2020]. Although the estimate for academia is likely inflated because R-users would more likely be aware of and respond to this sort of survey, the point remains that R is a widely used both inside and outside of academia.

None of these comparisons are to belittle other software. Every tool has it strengths and weaknesses. In the case of R, the great strength of the diversity of tools available is also a weakness in that the ecosystem can be overwhelming. Also, there are often multiple ways to achieve the same goal, which can make finding relevant information difficult in the beginning. Also, the ecosystem is changing rapidly [@staples2023] meaning that the learning never really stops.

## Using R

### Workflow

R exists as a standalone application that you instruct to do the things you want by typing commands at a prompt. However, if you want to make your life a lot more pleasant then we recommend using R from within the RStudio [@rstudioteam2016] integrated development environment (IDE); if you want to create beautiful reports or submission-ready manuscripts from within RStudio then you need to install something called Quarto [@quarto]. Therefore, before you start your R journey, install these three applications (see Resources for the URLs):

-   R
-   RStudio
-   Quarto

@fig-rrstudioquarto shows how these three applications interact. From a user perspective you only ever use RStudio because R and Quarto work behind the scenes. Within RStudio you create a new Quarto document, which is like a document from your favourite word processor except that you can insert so-called *code chunks* into which you type R code. @fig-rrstudioquarto shows a Quarto document on the left-hand side; notice that there is a heading followed by a paragraph of text, under which is a grey box containing some code.

To create a finished report, the document must be processed (or *rendered*) by clicking a button. When a Quarto document is rendered the text is processed by Quarto to apply formatting and generate headings, hyperlinks and citations, whereas anything in a code chunk is processed by R. In @fig-rrstudioquarto (right hand side) note that, after rendering, the textual paragraph has some hyperlinks and formatting applied by Quarto, and the code chunk has been processed by R to create a table (and the subsequent code chunk creates a plot).

![How R, RStudio and Quarto interact](images/r_rstudio_quarto_2025.png){#fig-rrstudioquarto}

Quarto documents can be rendered into an html file (the most convenient) but for scientific manuscripts you can also render to a pdf (but you need to have LaTeX installed) or Microsoft Word file. Before rendering, it is also possible to execute any code chunks from within your Quarto document allowing you to work on and check code without needing to render the entire document.

We can give only the briefest overview of the incredible power of RStudio, R and Quarto and suffice it to say there's an enormous amount to learn that we can't possibly cover. However, the resources section provides some video walk throughs and there is more detail in @fielddsr22026.

### Project files

The single most useful thing you can do when working with R is to use an RStudio project and organise it sensibly [@fielddsr22026]. An RStudio project is a folder containing a special file with the extension `.Rproj` that stores information about the containing folder and your environment. Most important, it sets the working directory to be the folder containing the project file, which means that accessing the files becomes a lot more straightforward than if you don't use an RStudio project. Provided you have stored the files you need for your project within your project folder, you will be able to access it using only its file name (because R will automatically look for the file in your project folder).

In terms of organising the project folder, @fielddsr22026 recommends at a minimum having a folder called `data` for any data files, and one called something like `quarto` or `docs` for your Quarto documents. Different projects will have different needs though, so may need other folders too. Space prevents a detailed explanation of how to set up a project, but the resources section provides a video walk through and there is more detail in @fielddsr22026.

### Packages and functions

Some functions are built into R, but others will be bundled into a package (see earlier). We install packages by executing

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
install.packages("name_of_package")
```

replacing "name_of_package" with the name of the package. This should be done outside of your Quarto document. Installing a package puts a copy of it on your computer so you only need to do it once or until you update R. However, to use a package you have to load it by including

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
library(name_of_package)
```

in a code chunk (we recommend your first code chunk) within your Quarto document (again replacing "name_of_package" with the name of the package). For example, if we want to use the package `here` [@here] we'd *go to the R console* within RStudio and execute

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
install.packages("here")
```

and to use it *within a Quarto document* we'd place

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
library(here)
```

in the first code chunk. (Note that `install.packages` requires the package name to be in quotes but `library` does not.) We can now use all of the functions within the parameters package.

### The Tidyverse

The Tidyverse [@tidyverse] is suite of packages containing a wide array of tools for data science that have been developed using a common underlying philosophy and grammar. It contains the following core packages:

-   `ggplot2` [@ggplot2]: a powerful system for plotting data.
-   `dplyr` [@dplyr]: tools for data wrangling.
-   `tidyr` [@tidyr]: tools for tidying data (see Working with data).
-   `readr` [@readr]: tools for importing data.
-   `purrr` [@purrr]: tools for functional programming.
-   `tibble` [@tibble]: tools for working with data frames.
-   `stringr` [@stringr]: tools for working with strings/text.
-   `forcats` [@forcats]: tools for working with categorical variables.
-   `lubridate` [@lubridate]: tools for working with times and dates.\

In addition, it contains some smaller packages with more specialised functions, notably `readxl` [@readxl] for importing Microsoft Excel files and `googlesheets4` [@googlesheets4] and `googledrive` [@googledrive]for working with Google sheets, and `haven` [@haven] for importing data files from IBM SPSS Statistics, Stata and SAS.

To install all of these packages in one command we'd *go to the R console* within RStudio and execute

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Having done this, then we can either load the ones we want to use individually within our Quarto document, for example

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
library(dplyr)
```

or load all of the core packages using

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
library(tidyverse)
```

Non-core packages have to be loaded individually. For example, if we want to use `readxl` then we have to execute

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
library(readxl)
```

even if we have already loaded the tidyverse.

### The `here()` function

Another important package when getting started is the `here` package, which is incredibly useful for importing data and more generally locating files within your project. The function `here()` from within the package of the same name [@here] returns the file path of the project folder and will, therefore, make your life easier and your work portable.

Let's imagine you have a data file called `data.csv` (imaginative name), stored in a folder called `data` which is in a folder called `my_project`. Imagine that this folder is on your hard drive in your main `Documents` folder, and that you use Windows. To enable R to access this file you would need to type the following file path (assuming you've stolen my name):

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
C:/Users/andyfield/Documents/my_project/data/data.csv
```

If your colleague tries to run your code, it will fail because they will be using their computer, not yours, and the data will be stored somewhere else. If you change computer, your code will fail unless you set it up exactly like your old one. However, by using a project folder we can access the data file with

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
here("data/data.csv")
```

which says "look for a folder called `data` within my project, and within that look for a file called `data.csv`". This code will work on any computer because `here()` finds the location of the current project, wherever it may be (e.g., "C:/Users/andyfield/Documents/my_project/"), and then adds the text within the function to the end of it. Wherever you have saved you project folder, `here()` will find it.

### Housekeeping

Although you can load packages within any code chunk within your Quarto document, we suggest loading them all in your first code chunk. Doing so allows you to easily keep track of the packages that the document depends upon and ensures that all the packages you need are loaded at the start of the rendering process. We'd also recommend loading them in alphabetic order to help avoid accidentally loading packages twice!

To follow our example analysis you will need to install the packages listed below, and then you're first code chunk should load them as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false


library(correlation)
library(here)
library(knitr)
library(parameters)
library(performance)
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Code fundamentals

Let's assume you have a Quarto document up and running and perhaps you have written some text to remind you about what you are about to do and why. Sooner or later you will want to do something using R. To do so you need to insert a code chunk by pressing simultaneously the *Ctrl*, *Alt* and *i* keys (Windows and Linux) or *Cmd*, *Option* and *i* on MacOS. This creates an area with a darker background that will have `{r}` at the top (@fig-codechunk). Anything typed within this area will be processed by R when the document renders. You can put as much code as you want in a single code chunk. At the extreme you could have a single code chunk in your Quarto document that does everything. However, it is better to break an analysis up into separate code chunks that relate to specific parts of your analysis, and to prepare tables and plots in self-contained code chunks.

You can process code while working on a Quarto document, which is known as *executing* or *running* the code. Running code as you write it is useful for seeing the results that you want to report and interpret without needing to render the entire document. Note in @fig-codechunk that code chunks have three icons. From left-to-right, the first opens a dialogue box to set options for the code chunk; the second executes all of the previous code chunks; and the last executes all of the code in the code chunk. The results of the code will be displayed below the code chunk in Quarto. You can also execute specific parts of your code by selecting it and pressing the *Ctrl* (*Cmd* on MacOS) and then the return key of your keyboard.

![Example of a code chunk](images/code_chunk_annotated.png){#fig-codechunk}

### Creating objects

Most commands in R have a common structure which can be summed up as:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
object <- instructions
```

The thing on the left is something you wish to create that you have decided to name 'object' (but you could have named it something else), and on the right will be some instructions about how to create it. In the middle is an arrow an arrow (\<-) known as the *assignment operator*, so called because it assigns what's on the right to the name on the left.

You can create many different types of 'object'; some examples are a table of data, a table of results, a statistical model, output from a statistical model, or a plot. For example, if we want to fit a linear model (regression) we can do this using code that has this general structure:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
my_lm <- lm()
```

The left hand side tells R to store the object we create using the name 'my_lm', and the right hand side tells R to use a function called `lm()` (the lm stands for linear model) to create it. So, what is a function?

A *function* is a bit of code that someone has written (and that you can write yourself) and takes the form `name_of_function()`. Some examples of functions are `lm()`, `mutate()`, and `ggplot()`. Within the brackets you specify pre-defined 'options' known as arguments, which vary across functions but essentially tell the function what you want it to do. For example, the `lm()` function, as a bare minimum, needs two arguments to be set, one is labelled 'formula' and the other 'data', so we could include these arguments in our code above:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
my_lm <- lm(formula, data)
```

Arguments are always separated by commas and require you to specify a value using `=`. (Sometimes arguments have default values in which case you don't need to include them unless you want to override that default.) The `lm()` function needs a formula specifying the linear model that you want, which takes the form `y ~ x` for one predictor and `y ~ x1 + x2 + ... xn` for multiple predictors. In each formula the 'y' and all the terms starting with 'x' need to be replaced with the names of variable within your data object. You also need to tell the function where to find the data using the `data` argument. For example, let's say we wanted to predict a variable called 'happiness' from another variable called 'relationship_satisfaction' and these variables were stored in an object called 'happy_data' then we could fit the model as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
happy_lm <- lm(formula = happiness ~ relationship_satisfaction, data = happy_data)
```

Executing this code will fit an OLS linear model that predicts happiness from relationship satisfaction and stores it in an object called `happy_lm`. We can extract from that object information such as model parameter estimates, fit statistics, residuals and so on because once an object has been created it is stored in R's memory. For example, if we have loaded the `parameters` package within our Quarto document

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
library(parameters)
```

we could use the `model_parameters` function from that package to extract the table of coefficients from our linear model by executing

```         
model_parameters(happy_lm)
```

### Naming objects

R is case sensitive, meaning that it will treat an object called `happy_lm` as being completely different to an object called `Happy_lm`. Humans are way more fallible to ignoring the case of letters so this case sensitivity is a common causes of R throwing an error. There are other conventions about which you need to be aware too. As a brief summary of the style recommended in @fielddsr22026:

-   Always use lower case letters to name things.
-   R treats a space as separating objects so you will get errors if you use spaces in object names, instead use an underscore (e.g. `relationship_satisfaction` not `relationship satisfaction`).
-   Be concise and meaningful. So, `relationship_satisfaction` probably fits the bill (although maybe we could truncate to something like `relation_satis` without losing meaning). A name like `scores_on_the_meaningfullness_of_my_relationships_scale` is meaningful but too long, and `rs` is concise but not meaningful.
-   Place spaces around all operators (=, +, -, \<-) to make code easier to read.
-   Use a suffix (consistently) to indicate what an object contains; for example, you might use `_lm` for a linear model or `_mod` for a model generally, `_tbl` for a table, `_out` for the output of a model and so on.\

### The pipe operator

Often when writing code we want to string several operations together. For example, you might want to filter and then sort your data. Sticking with our relationship satisfaction and happiness data (`happy_data`), imagine that we had a variable within the data called `duration` that recorded the length of the relationship in years and we wanted to filter out short-term relationships (which we define as less than a year). We also want to sort the data by this variable.

We can use the `filter()` function from the `dplyr` package to filter the data by loading `dplyr` in our first code chunk using `library(dplyr)` and later executing:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
long_happy <- filter(.data = happy_data, duration > 1)
```

This creates a new data object called `long_happy` and within the `filter()` function we specify the original data object that we want to filter (`.data = happy_data`) and we include a logical instruction (`duration > 1`) that says 'keep the case if the variable duration is greater than 1'. Remembering that `duration` is the number of years of the relationship, this will retain all cases where the relationship is more than a year old.

We can now sort this new data object using the `arrange()` function, also from `dplyr`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
long_happy_sort <- arrange(.data = long_happy, duration)
```

This creates a new data object called `long_happy_sort` and within the `arrange()` function we specify the filtered data object that we want to sort (`.data = long_happy`) and we include the variable by which we want to sort the data (`duration`).

To sum up, we could achieve the filtering and sorting by executing this code:

```{r}
#| eval: false

long_happy <- filter(.data = happy_data, duration > 1)
long_happy_sort <- arrange(.data = long_happy, duration)
```

This method is fine, but we've created multiple objects and we're now storing the same data in two objects(`long_happy` and `long_happy_sort`), so it might be more efficient to combine these functions:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
long_happy_sort <- arrange(.data = filter(.data = happy_data, duration > 1), duration)
```

Note that within `arrange()` we have replaced `long_happy` with `filter(.data = happy_data, duration > 1)` so instead of creating an object `long_happy` and using it, we use the code that filters the file directly. We have nested the `filter()` function within `arrange()`. This method has the advantage that we are not unnecessarily storing objects, but the disadvantage that it is difficult to read and understand.

In the interests of writing clear and easily-readable code, we recommend using the pipe operator (`|>`) to link functions. As its name suggest the pipe operator creates a pipeline between functions allowing the output of one function to 'flow' into the next. In the current example, we can use the pipe operator as follows:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
long_happy_sort <- filter(.data = happy_data, duration > 1) |> arrange(duration)
```

or more explicitly

```{r}
#| eval: false

long_happy_sort <- happy_data |>
  filter(duration > 1) |>
  arrange(duration)
```

We create `long_happy_sort` by starting the pipeline with the original data object (`happy_data`) which 'flows' into the `filter()` function. Note that within this function we no longer need to specify the data because `filter()` will assume it needs to use whatever is coming through the pipe. The `filter()` function does its job and then sends the resulting filtered data through the next pipe into `arrange()`, where it is sorted. The advantages of the pipe are that you avoid creating lots of intermediate objects and your code becomes very readable (it is clear that you start with some data, filter it and then sort it).

## Working with data

If you have worked with other Statistical or data management software you will be familiar with spreadsheets. These are typically interactive grids of columns and rows where you might type values or text and then save them as a data file. R does not have an interactive spreadsheet interface. If you want to enter data, you do it by creating variables using code and then binding these variables it in a data object known as a *data frame* or *tibble*. In case you are wondering, a 'tibble' is a special type of data frame that behaves in 3 subtly different ways that do not affect most users. We will ignore these differences and always refer to 'data frames'.

You'd be likely to enter data manually only for fairly small data sets, so we won't cover how to here, but see @fielddsr22026. More likely, you will have collected and stored data using specialist survey (e.g., Qualtrics, Survey Monkey) or experiment generator (e.g., Inquisit, ePrime, and PsychoPy) software. Alternatively, if it does need to be entered manually, you might choose to use an interactive spreadsheet such as Microsoft Excel, numbers, Apache OpenOffice or Google sheets. As mentioned earlier the Tidyverse has several specialist packages for importing different types of data file, but often importing will go more smoothly if you export the data into a text-based file format such as CSV or tab-delimited text before importing into R.

### Importing data

In our example analysis we will use the data from @perchtold2019 (link in the resources), which downloads as an Excel file (`pone.0211618.s002.xlsx`). Fortunately, we can use the `read_excel` function from the `readxl` packages which is loaded as part of `tidyverse`. Let's assume we have downloaded the data file and saved it in a folder called `data` within our main project folder. We can import the data using the following code:

```{r}
#| eval: false

perchtold_df <- here("data/pone.0211618.s002.xlsx") |> 
  read_excel()
```

This code uses `here()` to get the full file path for the data file by appending the text within the function to the file path for the project. This file path is then piped into `read_excel()`, which reads in the file and converts it to a data frame, we save this data frame as `perchtold_df` (but we could have named it anything).

Similarly, had the file been a CSV file we could have done the same thing using `read_csv()` from the `readr` package.

```{r}
#| eval: false

perchtold_df <- here("data/pone.0211618.s002.csv") |> 
  read_csv()
```

To view an object, we can select the name of the object in our code chunk and execute it. RStudio will display the object below the code chunk. If we want to view our data we should select `perchtold_df` and press *Ctrl* (*Cmd* on MacOS) and then the return key. Note that the data have been read in as a series of columns, each representing a variable, and each row represents a participant (@fig-perchtolddf).

![Data from Perchtold et al. (2019)](images/perchtold_df.png){#fig-perchtolddf}

### Data types

When a data file is imported the function used takes an educated guess at what each column contains. For example, in @fig-perchtolddf note that each column has `<dbl>` underneath, which indicates that `read_excel` thinks that these columns contain numbers with decimals. R recognises the following data types, which are labelled with abbreviations of the highlighted word:

-   `int`: numbers in *integer* format (i.e., whole numbers).
-   `dbl`: numbers in *double*-precision floating-point format. In layperson terms these are any real number. Doubles have decimal places whereas integers do not.
-   `chr`: values containing strings of *characters*. In other words text.
-   `fct`: a special kind of character variable where the text strings represent categories or groups. This kind of variable is known as a *factor*. When a variable is designated as a factor, each unique text string is stored as a 'level' of a categorical variable. An example of a factor would be a variable that takes the values 'Treatment' and 'Control' depending on whether a person was assigned to a treatment condition or a control group. When you want to fit models with categorical variables, you will work with factors.
-   `date`: values that contain dates.
-   `lgl`: values that are either TRUE or FALSE, known as *logical* or boolean values.\

Although functions for importing variables typically do a good job of guessing the data type, they do get it wrong (dates in Excel are particularly messy) so you might need to manually specify the data type of each column within the function, or change the data type after the data has been imported. It is fair to say there is a lot to learn about processing data, which we do not have room to explore, but see @fielddsr22026.

### Accessing variables

Sometimes we might want to extract a particular column or variable from a data frame, or work with a subset of the variables. When working with a single variable the easiest way to access it is using the `$` symbol. In general terms:

```{r}
#| eval: false

dataframe$variable_name
```

Let's say we wanted to work with the variable called `psyc` within the `perchtold_df` data frame, we would do this using

```{r}
#| eval: false

perchtold_df$psyc
```

If we want a selection of variables we can use `select()` from `dplyr`, which takes the form

```{r}
#| eval: false

select(.data = name_of_dataframe, list_of_variables)
```

For example, if we wanted to use only the variables `psych`, `pos3` and `pos7` in our data frame we could achieve this using

```{r}
#| eval: false

select(.data = perchtold_df, psych, pos3, pos7)
```

or using the pipe:

```{r}
#| eval: false

perchtold_df |> 
  select(psych, pos3, pos7)
```

## Example analysis

To demonstrate R's extensive analytic capability, we use open data from a study conducted by @perchtold2019. In this study 95 qualified participants aged 17 to 35 years completed the Reappraisal Inventiveness Test (RIT), humorous adaptation, and depression questionnaires. Participants were confronted with 4 anxiety-provoking situations (e.g. *Late at night, you are the only one left working at the office. As you are sitting at your desk, suddenly all the lights on your floor switch off*) and were asked to write as many humorous ways as they could think of to diminish anxiety. Each of the humorous explanations (or reappraisals) was classified into RIT categories; which were further classified into either positive reinterpretation strategy (situation-focused reappraisal) or a de-emphasizing strategy (self-focused reappraisal). Participants also completed the Center for Epidemiology Studies depression scale (CES-D, variable name `ads`), resulting in an overall score from 1 to 48, with higher scores indicating a greater number of self-reported depressive experiences [@radloff1977].

We begin by demonstrating some of R's statistical functions using a one-sample *t*-test, which is not found in Perchtold et al. Thereafter, we use R to replicate some the analyses reported in @perchtold2019. Specifically, we replicate some of Table 2 on page 8 of @perchtold2019:

-   The correlations and *p*-values in column 3 (labelled *r(p)*).
-   The unstandardized parameter estimates (regression coefficients) and their associated estimated standard errors in column 5 (labelled *B(se)*).\

Remember from earlier sections that our Quarto document should begin with a code chunk that loads the libraries we need and reads in the data file.

```{r}

### One-Sample *t*-Test

A first analysis determines whether the participants differ from a sample diagnosed with clinical depression. Depressive symptoms were measured with the CES-D. Based on the original study that describes the scale [@radloff1977], a score of 16 or more is interpreted as indicating depression; however, more recent work with clinical samples suggests that a score of 21 or more has better sensitivity and specificity in discriminating samples with clinical depression from general population samples [@shean2008]. Therefore, our hypothesis that participants differ from a sample diagnosed with clinical depression can be tested using a one-sample *t*-test. Let's assume that before collecting data we set the Type I error rate to be $\alpha$ = 0.05.

-   H_0: the true mean CES-D is equal to 21
-   H_1: the true mean CES-D is less than 21\

In R we perform a *t*-test of this hypothesis using the `t.test()` function which is available in base R. The general form of the `t-test()` is shown below:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
t.test(x, y = NULL,
       alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
       mu = 0, paired = FALSE, var.equal = FALSE,
       conf.level = 0.95, …)
```

Note that the function includes arguments that specify: `x`, the variable from a data frame (or vector of data); `alternative`, a text string indicating whether the test is two-sided or one-sided and the one-sided test ("less" or "greater"), `mu`, the value against which you're testing (by default zero); `conf.level`, the confidence level; `paired`, whether the data are `paired` (e.g. dependent); and, `var.equal`, whether variances are assumed to be equal (by default they are not assumed equal and we advise not changing this argument). The last two arguments apply only when a two-sample *t*-test is performed.

For our data, we want to test the variable `ads` in the data, we can access this variable in the `perchtold_df` data frame using `perchtold_df$ads` (see earlier) so we set `x = perchtold_df$ads`. We want to compare the sample mean of this variable to a value of 21 so we set `mu = 21`, and we are interested specifically in whether the sample mean is less than 21 (a one-tailed test) so we set `alternative = "less"`. We have saved the results in an object that we've chosen to call `depression_ost` (we can use whatever name we like, but the `_ost` reminds us it is a *o*ne-*s*ample *t*-test). To look at the text output of the *t*-test we execute `depression_ost` as on the second line.

```{r}
#| label: One-sample t-test
#| eval: false

depression_ost <- t.test(x = perchtold_df$ads, mu = 21, alternative = "less" ) 
depression_ost
```

The text output looks like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

depression_ost <- t.test(x = perchtold_df$ads, mu = 21, alternative = "less" ) 
depression_ost
```

The default text output isn't really suitable for reports or journal articles, but the function `model_parameters()` in the `parameters` package [@parameters] can be used to create consistent tabulated output from many statistical functions including `t.test()` and `lm()`. Therefore, having created and stored the object `depression_ost`, we can create a nicely formatted table by placing it into this function. Further formatting can be achieved by piping this table into the `display()` function from the `insights` package, where, among other things you can set the number of decimal places shown using three arguments: `digits` (2 by default) sets the number of decimal places for any numeric values except confidence intervals and *p*-values\]; `ci_digits` (also 2 by default) sets the decimal places for confidence intervals; and `p_digits` (3 by default) sets the number of decimal places for *p*-values. So, for example, if you wanted one decimal place in general, but 3 for confidence intervals and 4 for *p* values you would use `display(digits = 1, ci_digits = 3, p_digits = 4)`. However, if we use the sensible defaults we could display a table using:

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
model_parameters(depression_ost) |> 
  display()
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ost
#| caption: Using `model_parameters` to create tabulated output
#| echo: false

model_parameters(depression_ost) |> 
  display()
```

On examination of the output (@tbl-ost) the *p*-value for this test is < 0.001 which is less our criterion $\alpha$ = 0.05. Therefore, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis and conclude at the 5% level of significance that the true mean CES-D value is less than 21.

### Correlation Coefficient

Perchtold and colleagues correlate self-reported depressive experiences to each of the three sub-strategies within the positive reinterpretation strategy (general positive aspects (`pos3`), worst-case comparison (`pos7`), disadvantage as advantage `(pos8`)) and each of the three sub-strategies within the de-emphasizing category (alternative explanation (`rel10`), trivializing the problem (`rel11`), handing over responsibility (`rel14`)). These correlation coefficients can be found in Table 2 of the Perchtold article in the column labelled 'r(p)'.

The `correlation()` function in the `correlation` package [@correlation] can be used to generate correlation coefficients between all columns in a data frame as well as *p*-values and confidence intervals. This function has the general form:

```{r}
#| eval: false

correlation::correlation(data = my_dataframe,
                         method = "pearson",
                         p_adjust = "holm",
                         ci = 0.95)
```

Only the main arguments and their defaults are shown. Use `data` to specify the name of the data frame containing the variables that you wish to correlate, `method` to set the correlation coefficient (by default Pearson but you can use Kendall or Spearman's method with `method = "kendall"` and `method = "spearman"` respectively), `p_adjust` to define a method for correcting *p*-values for the number of tests conducted (by default the Holm method is used but others are available), and `ci` to set the confidence interval width as a proportion (by default it is 0.95 for a 95% confidence interval).

To get the correlations we need we could pipe our data frame into the `select()` function, which we met earlier, to select the variables we need, and then pipe this into `correlation()`. Perchtold and colleagues did not adjust their *p*-values for the number of tests, so we need to over-ride the default of `p_adjust = "holm"` with `p_adjust = "none"` to replicate their results exactly

```{r}
#| label: Correlation with unadjusted p-values
#| eval: false

perchtold_df |>
  select(ads, pos3, pos7, pos8, rel10, rel11, rel14) |>
  correlation(p_adjust = "none")
```

If you run this code you will see, for example, the unadjusted *p*-value of the `ads`-`pos3` correlation equals $-0.023$, matching the value reported in Perchtold Table 2. Other things being equal, it's good practice to adjust the *p*-values when using multiple tests, so let's do that by leaving the defaults as they are (note the brackets of the `correlation` function are now empty). We will also save the results as `perchtold_cor` so that we have more options for printing the output as a table.

```{r}
#| label: Correlation

perchtold_cor <- perchtold_df |>
  select(ads, pos3, pos7, pos8, rel10, rel11, rel14) |>
  correlation()
```

For the purpose of report-writing we could pipe `perchtold_cor` into `display()` to produce a tabulated output (@tbl-cor). Note that the correlation coefficients are reported in the `r` column; for example, the correlation coefficient for the `ads`-`pos3` pair is $-0.23$. The *p*-values have now been adjusted for multiple comparisons so note that the adjusted *p*-value of the `ads`-`pos3` correlation coefficient has changed to 0.434.

```{r}
#| eval: false

perchtold_cor |> 
  display()
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-cor
#| tbl-cap: Correlation coefficients from Perchtold et al. (Table 2)
#| echo: false

perchtold_cor |> 
  display()
```

### Multiple Linear Regression

#### Fitting the model

@perchtold2019 also used multivariate linear regression to test whether three sub-strategies within the positive reinterpretation strategy (general positive aspects (`pos3`), worst-case comparison (`pos7`), disadvantage as advantage (`pos8`)) and three sub-strategies within the de-emphasizing category (alternative explanation (`rel10`), trivializing the problem (`rel11`), handing over responsibility (`rel14`)) are predictive of self-reported depressive experiences measured via the CES-D depression scale (`ads`). These results are reported in Table 2 of @perchtold2019.

> AF NOTE: should we delete Q4 - see later?

Several of the research questions that can be answered using multiple linear regression:

1.  Do *any* of the six reappraisal strategies have a linear relationship to self-reported depressive experience? (overall test of the model)
2.  Which of the six strategies explain variation in self-reported depressive experience? (test the estimated parameter for each strategy against a value of 0)
3.  What is the likely size of the relationship between a specific strategy and self-reported depressive experience? (inspect the confidence interval for a parameter under certain assumptions)\

In R we answer these questions by estimating a linear regression using the `lm()` function. We designate the data frame which is stored in object `perchtold_df` and specify the model using a formula with the dependent variable on the left side of a tilde (`~`) and the explanatory variables on the right side of the tilde, separated by plus (+) signs.

```{r}
#| eval: false

ads ~ pos3 + pos7 + pos8 + rel10 + rel11 + rel14
```

The estimated model can be written to an object, which we have chosen to call `ads_reg` in this case, and a text summary of the model results can be viewed using the `summary()` function.

```{r}
#| label: Multiple Regression
#| eval: false
ads_reg <- lm(data = perchtold_df, ads ~ pos3 + pos7 + pos8 + rel10 + rel11 + rel14) 
summary(ads_reg)
```

The text output looks like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

ads_reg <- lm(data = perchtold_df, ads ~ pos3 + pos7 + pos8 + rel10 + rel11 + rel14) 
summary(ads_reg)
```

#### Classes and Lists

The text summary is fine, but for reports we might want to extract specific information from the model. When R fits any model it produce useful data elements that are unseen in the output that is printing by using a function like `summary()`. For example, the output produced in an object created by the `lm()` function includes useful data such as all of the residuals and fitted values. These do not need to be calculated; you just need to learn how to extract them.

The first step is to write your output to an object like we did when we created `ads_reg`. The object will have standardized names for the information it contains and will store this information in something called a *list*. A list object is like a bucket: it contains things, and these things can be different from one another. Whereas a data frame or tibble must have a fixed number of rows across all columns, a list is not limited to that structure. A list can contain a character vector of length 1 and also a numeric array with dimensions $n\times k$.

In R, each object created in a particular way is designated as a class. For example, an object created by `lm()` has the same structure and is designated as a class "lm" object. Classes allow the creation of a template to store information, and just as importantly, to extract information. For example, every "lm" class object will contain residuals, fitted values, etc... and users can write functions or packages to manipulate data produced as a class-\[insert class name\] object such as a `class-lm` object. Most of us will not write our own functions to extract information from a class. Instead, we use existing packages and functions to do that for us. For example, when we put our `ads_reg` model, which we created with `lm()`, into the function `model_parameters()` it checks its class (and complains if it is a class that it doesn't recognise) and having identified its class as `class-lm` it knows how to navigate the list of objects contained within it and find the parameter estimates. It does so before processing this information into a table for us.

#### Extracting information from the model and reporting it

To create tabulated reports of our model we can again use `model_parameters()` to extract parameter estimates from `ads_reg` and tabulate them for us. Similarly, to obtain fit statistics, we can use the `model_performance()` function, and to test the fit we can use `test_wald()` both from the `performance` package [@performance]. The `performance` package also has the function `check_model()` to produce assumption checks, but space prevents us from exploring this function here.

##### Question 1: Do *any* of the six reappraisal strategies have a linear relationship to self-reported depressive experience?

To get overall fit statistics of the model and test it, we can place the model we created `ads_reg` into `model_performance()` and `test_wald()` respectively. When only one model is provided to `test_wald()` it will compare it to a model with no predictors. The output tells us that the model was a significant fit of the data (i.e., including predictors significantly improves the fit), *F*(6, 88) = 2.63, *p* = 0.022. The fit statistics tell us that the model accounts for 9.4% of the depression scores when adjusting for the number of predictors ($R^2_{\text{adj}}$ = 0.094).

```{r}
#| eval: false
 
model_performance(ads_reg)
test_wald(ads_reg)
```

The text output looks like this:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true

model_performance(ads_reg)
test_wald(ads_reg)
```

##### Question 2: Which of the six strategies explain variation in self-reported depressive experience?

To answer this question, we need the model parameters and tests of whether they differ from 0. We can obtain these in tabulated form by placing our model in `model_parameters()` and using `display()` to print it nicely (and optionally set the number of decimal places). @tbl-pe shows that `pos3` and `pos7` significantly predicted depression (their *p*-values are less than our a priori alpha of 0.05). The estimates themselves tell us that as general positive aspects increase by one unit, depression on the ADS falls by 4.37 units, and as worst-case comparison increases by one unit, depression on the ADS increases by 4.73 units.

```{r}
#| eval: false
model_parameters(ads_reg) |> 
  display()
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-pe
#| tbl-cap: "Parameter estimates from Perchtold et al. (Table 2)"
#| echo: false
 
model_parameters(ads_reg) |> 
  display()
```

##### Question 3: what is the likely size of the relationship between a specific strategy and self-reported depressive experience?

To address this question, we need to look at the confidence intervals for each parameter estimate and interpret them under certain important assumptions [see @fielddsr22026]. A 95% confidence interval is constructed such that the population or true value of the estimate will fall within the interval for 95% of samples *in the long run*. It does not tell us the interval within which the true population falls unless we *assume that our sample is one of the 95% that contains the population value* and accept that this assumption will be wrong 5% of the time. Under this (possibly incorrect assumption) we could say from @tbl-pe that, for example, the likely size of effect for general positive aspects is between -7.03 and and -1.72. In other words, the best case scenario is that as general positive aspects increase by one unit, depression on the ADS falls by 7.03 units, but the worst case scenario is it falls by only 1.72 units. You can interpret the other confidence intervals in a similar way.

## Summary

R is a powerful tool in the workflow of the open scientist. In conjunction with RStudio and Quarto it enables the user to produce production-ready reports and articles that embed the statistical analysis within. This makes documents portable and reproducible. R has a steep learning curve, but to get started the key things are to establish good workflow practices (use RStudio projects, be organised) and to not be afraid to 'have a go'. We have shown that with relatively little code (and experience) it is possible to fit statistical models and create summary tables from them that are embedded within a single document. The rest, is up to you.
